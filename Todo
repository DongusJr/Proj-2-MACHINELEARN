Copy agent command (right click, cli)

Fix chart positioning

Graph colours - validate

Crash:

1) Highlight simulation situations: labour market when full employment
                                    govt when in debt/default
								    companies when bankrupt.

Fix: +path to run.bat

Duplicate output directory detection for batch file runs

Performance (improve inc_x):

Agents:
======

NTH: Constant money bank (override lending to prevent)
 - update Simulation doc. when done

Features:
=========

Documentation.

Tooltips on charts (Tooltip.install)

Turn on debugging through gui
Expose RNG

Add account types to Banks:
		savings accounts paying interest.

Better configuration for loans/interest rate

Click on Worker in deposit menu and view individual details

Bank presence not enforced by MarketView -> 
     Create account at central Bank?
     Add account move feature 

Add want configuration to WorkerProfile

Add ability to change initial bid/ask to market

Configure to screen size

Move accounts between banks

Copy agent command for CLI

NTH:
====

  Remove workers, markets, etc.
  Enable/Disable agent from gui option

Timed events:
  @ step x do y 

View transactions/agent from Summary screen

Chart panel - select set of statistics for display

Windows build.bat, run.bat - auto sense java path

Bugs
====

Statistics:: inventory not working

Region not set in marketview

Bank/Loan viewer not cleared on load

Save incorrect for workbank

Reserve pctage not saved

Why are  BankInvestors ending up on labourmarket  - stop this properly

Refactoring
===========

Rewrite labourview to handle worker creation and configuration better.
   - merge with bank ??

ChartController - lay out grid in multiple columns when necessary

SimulationEngine - make containers final?

Add additional load file to entry screen - provide default markets etc.

List
====

Markets:  Convert linked list to hashmap

Refactoring:

Waiting for Java 9:
  Cell spanning

Futures:
========

Multiple markets containers:
   will require capture to config file in order to regenerate when
   being reloaded.
   markets : id {list of users} {list of container markets}`
