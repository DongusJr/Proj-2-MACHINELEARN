This is what I did to get Threadneedle working in Eclipse. If you know a better way, please let me know.

First of all, make sure you have the latest version of Eclipse (Luna).

Open Eclipse and direct it to the workspace directory of your choice 
(I'll just call it $workspace). 

Create a new Java 8 Project ($project).

Eclipse will now have made a directory for your project and within that a 
folder for your source files.

Put the Threadneedle directory within this source folder so you get 
$workspace/$project/src/Threadneedle/. 

(move it from elsewhere on your computer or `git clone https://github.com/jackymallett/Threadneedle.git`)

You may need to refresh the src folder in Eclipse to see the Threadneedle files.

Go to the Properties of your new project and then to Java Build Path and the Libraries tab.

For some reason I needed to remove the JRE System Library, and then add it back through the "Add Library" button.

You also need to add all the JAR files in the $workspace/$project/src/Threadneedle/lib directory.

The project should now compile.

Right-click Threadneedle.java file in the gui directory and select 
Run as Java Application (it won't work) and may crash with an exception, 
but it will have added Threadneedle to the Run Configurations.

Go to Run Configurations, click on Java Application, and select the Classpath 
tab, select User Entries, click "Advanced" and then "Add folders" and add $workspace/$project/src/Threadneedle/resources.
Now select the Arguments tab and change the Working Directory to $workspace/$project/src/Threadneedle.
If you are on Mac, there may be a checkbox beneath the VM Arguments box about using the -XstartOnFirstThread argument when launching SWT that you need to untick.

Now if you run Threadneedle again it should hopefully work.

If when you try to run Threadneedle, the JVM (java) starts, but nothing else happens. There is
a difference of opinion between eclipse and osx on how javafx interacts with previous libraries.

Go back to the Run configurations panel, and go to the Arguments tab. Underneath the VM
arguments box you should see a checkbox with the option -XstartOnFirstThread 
Uncheck this, and it should resolve the problem.
